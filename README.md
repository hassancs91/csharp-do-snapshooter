Simple c# application that allows you to manage your Digital Ocean Snapshots and automate Tasks

Hey Friends!

If you have used Digital Ocean Cloud Services, you then know that you can take snapshots of your machine as a backup.
I created this small application that utlizez the Digital Ocean API in a small C# windowsforms app using curl under windows and simple process
then I read the json results and showed them is a clear view in the form.

Th application allows you to:
1- Enumerate your Droplets
2- Get Snapshots per droplet
3- Create Snapshots in bulk
4- Delete Snapshots in bulk
5- Get all Snapshots and estimate your monthly cost.
